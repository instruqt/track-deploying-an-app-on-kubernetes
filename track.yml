  In a pre-orchestration world, installation scripts would often be used to start applications, but they did not allow recovery from machine failure.

  By both creating your application instances and keeping them running across Nodes, Kubernetes Deployments provide a fundamentally different approach to application management.

      Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can **deploy** your **containerized applications** on top of it.

      To do so, you create a Kubernetes **Deployment configuration**.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The Deployment instructs Kubernetes **how to create and update** instances of your application.

      Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes master **schedules** mentioned application **instances onto individual Nodes** in the cluster.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the **container image** for your application and the **number of replicas** that you want to run.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You can create and manage a Deployment by using the **Kubernetes command line interface, Kubectl**.

      Kubectl uses the **Kubernetes API** to interact with the cluster.

  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You interact with Kubernetes objects by submitting a definition.
      This definition is a declaration of a desired state.

      Desired state is a very important concept in the Kubernetes model.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Many things present a desired state to the system, and it is Kubernetes' responsibility to make sure that the current state matches the desired state.

      For example, when you create a Pod, you declare that you want the containers in it to be running.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      If the containers happen to not be running (e.g. program failure, etc.), Kubernetes will continue to (re-)create them for you in order to drive them to the desired state.

      This process continues until the Pod is deleted.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The simplest pod definition describes the deployment of a single container.

      For example, an nginx web server pod might be defined as such:
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.7.9
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80

      **Pods** are the **atomic unit** on the Kubernetes platform.
      When you create a Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment **creates Pods** with **containers inside** them.

      Each Pod is **tied to the Node** where it is scheduled, and remains there **until termination or deletion**.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      A Pod represents a group of **one or more** application containers, and some **shared resources** for those containers:
      - **Shared storage**, as Volumes
      - **Networking**, as a unique cluster IP address
      - **Information about how to run each container**, such as the container image version or specific ports to use
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      A Pod contains application containers that are **relatively tightly coupled**.

      The containers in a Pod share an IP Address and port space, are **always co-located and co-scheduled**, and run in a shared context on the same Node.
