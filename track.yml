title: Deploying an app on Kubernetes
teaser: Learn how to run applications on Kubernetes.
description: |-
  In a pre-orchestration world, installation scripts would often be used to start applications, but they did not allow recovery from machine failure.

  By both creating your application instances and keeping them running across Nodes, Kubernetes Deployments provide a fundamentally different approach to application management.

  teaser: Run your first application on Kubernetes from the command-line.

      Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can **deploy** your **containerized applications** on top of it.

      To do so, you create a Kubernetes **Deployment configuration**.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The Deployment instructs Kubernetes **how to create and update** instances of your application.

      Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes master **schedules** mentioned application **instances onto individual Nodes** in the cluster.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the **container image** for your application and the **number of replicas** that you want to run.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You can create and manage a Deployment by using the **Kubernetes command line interface, Kubectl**.

      ```
      kubectl run <name> --image=<container-image> --port=<container-port>
      ```

      Kubectl uses the **Kubernetes API** to interact with the cluster.
  assignment: |-
    Run the **nginx docker image** using **port 80** on Kubernetes, by using **kubectl**.

    Be sure to:
    - use **port 80**
    - name it **nginx**
    - use the **nginx image** from the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)

    You can check if everything is working correctly by **refreshing the Kubernetes tab** and checking the deployments.

    If you need more help, try **kubectl run --help**.

  title: Remove an application
  teaser: Get rid of the application that you started.
  notes:
  - type: text

      When you want to **stop** your application, you need to **remove it** from the Kubernetes cluster.

      Removing the deployment will also **destroy** any **underlying containers**.
  - type: text

      You can **delete the deployment** using the Kubernetes command line tool, kubectl:

  title: Definition files
  teaser: Take a look at the way objects are defined in Kubernetes.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You interact with Kubernetes objects by **submitting a definition**.
      This definition is a **declaration of a desired state**.

      Desired state is a very important concept in the Kubernetes model.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Many things present a desired state to the system, and it is Kubernetes' responsibility to make sure that the **current state matches the desired state**.

      For example, when you create a Pod, you declare that you want the containers in it to be running.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      If the containers happen to **not be running** (e.g. program failure, etc.), Kubernetes will continue to **(re-)create them** for you in order to **drive them to the desired state**.

      This process continues until the Pod is deleted.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      **Pods** are the **atomic unit** on the Kubernetes platform.
      When you create a Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment **creates Pods** with **containers inside** them.

      Each Pod is **tied to the Node** where it is scheduled, and remains there **until termination or deletion**.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      A Pod represents a group of **one or more** application containers that are **relatively tightly coupled**, and some **shared resources** for those containers:
      - **Shared storage**, as Volumes
      - **Networking**, as a unique cluster IP address
      - **Information about how to run each container**, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

      Pods are **always co-located and co-scheduled** and run in a shared context on the same Node.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The simplest **pod definition** describes the deployment of a **single container**.
  assignment: |-
    We have created a simple **pod definition** file for you.

    Take a look at the contents of **nginx.yml**.

      You can submit definitions to the Kubernetes API with kubectl:

      Instead of opening the file yourself and applying the changes, you can also use:
      ```
      kubectl edit pod/<name>
      ```

      This can be used for any Kubernetes resource by replacing pod with the resource type.

    There is a newer version of the nginx Docker image.

    Update the version of the nginx container to be 1.13.8-alpine by using the edit command.

      Removing all resources defined in a Kubernetes definition can be easily done with:
